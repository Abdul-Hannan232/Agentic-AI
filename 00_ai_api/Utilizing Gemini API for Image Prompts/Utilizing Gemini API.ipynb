It assumes you have a Google Cloud project set up with the necessary APIs enabled and billing configured.\n","\n","**1. Setup and Installation:**\n","\n","```python\n","!pip install google-generativeai\n","\n","import os\n","from google.generativeai import GenerateImageRequest, Client\n","\n","# Set your project ID.  Replace 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID' with your actual project ID.\n","os.environ['GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT'] = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'\n","\n","# Authenticate.  This might require you to follow a link and authenticate in your browser.\n","#  You'll likely need to enable the Gemini API in the Google Cloud Console.\n","client = Client()\n","```\n","\n","**2. Image Generation:**\n","\n","The core function uses `client.generate_image`.  We'll create a simple example:\n","\n","\n","```python\n","prompt = \"A majestic cat sitting on a fluffy cloud, artstation\" # Experiment with different prompts!\n","\n","response = client.generate_image(\n","    GenerateImageRequest(\n","        prompt=prompt,\n","        model=\"gemini-pro\", # or \"gemini-ultra\" if available and you have access.\n","        width=512,  # Adjust as needed\n","        height=512, # Adjust as needed\n","        num_images=1,  # Generate multiple images by increasing this number\n","    )\n",")\n","\n","# Access the generated images.  This is a list of image objects.\n","images = response.results\n","\n","# Download and display the image(s)  (requires appropriate libraries like matplotlib)\n","for i, image in enumerate(images):\n","    print(f\"Downloading image {i+1}...\")\n","    with open(f\"generated_image_{i+1}.png\", \"wb\") as f:\n","        f.write(image.binary)\n","    print(f\"Image {i+1} saved as generated_image_{i+1}.png\")\n","\n","    # Display the image (requires matplotlib)\n","    # from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","    # from PIL import Image\n","    # img = Image.open(f\"generated_image_{i+1}.png\")\n","    # plt.imshow(img)\n","    # plt.show()\n","```\n","\n","\n","**3.  Important Considerations:**\n","\n","* **Model Selection:**  Use `\"gemini-pro\"`  or `\"gemini-ultra\"` depending on your needs and access level. `\"gemini-ultra\"` generally produces higher-quality images but is more expensive.\n","* **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling.  Add `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions (e.g., network errors, API rate limits, invalid prompts).\n","* **Billing:**  Generating images with the Gemini API incurs costs. Monitor your Google Cloud usage carefully.\n","* **Prompt Engineering:**  The quality of your generated images heavily depends on the prompt. Experiment with different phrasing, keywords (like \"artstation\", \"photorealistic\", \"8k\"), and artistic styles to get the desired results.\n","* **Image Size:** Adjust `width` and `height` to control the resolution. Larger images take longer to generate and cost more.\n","* **`num_images`:**  Generate multiple images with a single request by increasing `num_images`.\n","\n","\n","**Before running:**\n","\n","* **Enable the Gemini API:** In the Google Cloud Console, ensure the Gemini API is enabled for your project.\n","* **Install Matplotlib (Optional):** If you want to display the images directly in Colab, uncomment and install `matplotlib` and `Pillow` : `!pip install matplotlib Pillow`\n","\n","\n","Remember to replace `\"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\"` with your actual Google Cloud project ID. This expanded guide provides a more robust starting point for generating images with the Gemini Flash API in Colab. Remember to always be mindful of your project's billing.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 4.\n","\n","Let's download an image to give it as a input later."],"metadata":{"id":"Awie-mgp8AIk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!curl -o image.jpg \"https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/jetpack.jpg\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ziud0IvG3l80","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735064278142,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":415,"user":{"displayName":"Abdul Hannan","userId":"06335349339058640158"}},"outputId":"7db1d50d-07c4-42d9-be38-e0d5a332bff9"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n","                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n","\r  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0\r100  349k  100  349k    0     0  2286k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2297k\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 5.\n","\n","Let's load the image and check it's details."],"metadata":{"id":"B4ZB4fOJ8IlD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import PIL.Image\n","img = PIL.Image.open(\"image.jpg\")\n","img"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":923,"output_embedded_package_id":"190amWUXMgGKg_nEHOp1RNDA-4xl1rghV"},"id":"lBoAPONp41Of","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1735064372634,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":3912,"user":{"displayName":"Abdul Hannan","userId":"06335349339058640158"}},"outputId":"bd3d4429-e390-40e6-cc85-e79750636baa"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Output hidden; open in https://colab.research.google.com to view."},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 6.\n","\n","Write Prompt and store in a variable."],"metadata":{"id":"kGy3NH5v8OSo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt = \"\"\"The image I am providing to you contains information of a product I am willing to sale on ecommerce platforms.\n","Extract the complete information from the image.
